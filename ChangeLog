      Patch by Johannes Winkelmann

* 0.2.1 Released 2005-05-08
    - Add a timeout block around the ftp related part of
      fetch_page(). Necessary if a ftp server is resolvable
      but do not respond to queries. Tunable via the global
      Ftp_time variable, default is 20 seconds.

* 0.2.0 Released 2005-02-20
    - Use ruby resolver library to get multi-threading even 
      for DNS queries. Nice speed improvement.
    - Use URI instead of regex in fetch_page to detect uri 
      classes.
    - Fix thread joining. In some rare circumstance ck4up
      doesn't finish program execution.
    - Use GetoptLong to parse commandline options. Now long
      options are available and options can be combined.
    - Join commandline arguments with '|' to build a or'ed
      regular expression.
    - Move test of Basedir into a function.
    - Use sync library instead of Thread.critical

* 0.1.10 Released 2005-02-06

      default now. Can be changed with the Ftp_passiv variable.

    - Concat the output of the ftp list command with newlines,
      which simplifies parsing with regular expressions.
